Need to have [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js website")<br>
To install node modules run: `npm install`<br>
If you want to run on multiple machines in dev you need to run (on windows): `set REACT_APP_LOCAL_IP=(yourlocalip eg 192.168.1.159)`<br>
To start server and react app just need to run: `npm start` <br>
To build run: `npm run build` <br>
To upload to heroku run: `git push heroku master`
